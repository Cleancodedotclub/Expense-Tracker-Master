React JS Expense Tracker Master is a GitHub repository that contains the source code for a simple expense tracking application built using React.js. The application allows users to enter their daily expenses and income, categorize them, and track their spending over time. The user interface is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a clean and minimalist design.

The application is built using modern React.js concepts such as functional components, hooks, and the Context API. It uses local storage to persist data between sessions, and it includes a number of features such as filtering and sorting expenses, adding and editing categories, and generating reports and charts.

The repository contains all the source code for the application, including the React components, the CSS stylesheets, and the data management logic. It also includes documentation and instructions for setting up and running the application locally, as well as a live demo hosted on Netlify. This repository can be used as a starting point for building more complex expense tracking applications using React.js.
